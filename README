slib
====

A general purpose library of C utilities. It grew from more or less
random collection of C modules that I had been writing since the end
of 1990s for many different projects. Most of the code falls into these
two categories:

1. Portable C utilities (arrays, lists, string buffers etc.)
2. Platform-independent APIs for platform specific things (e.g. threads)

Supported platforms are Windows, various flavours of Unix and Windows
kernel (yes, kernel!). Other platforms were supported in the past
(epoc, Linux kernel) and then dropped. Don't be surprised if you see
some artefacts of that scattered around the code.

slib was typically built as a static library. Just because I like it
when the executables have as few external dependencies as possible.

I'm not sure how useful it is these days, when there's glib and other
similar libraries, much more functional than slib. But you never know.
If nothing else, it can be used as a copy-paste material, in which case
I would appreciate if you somehow acknowledge that fact. Obviously,
there's no way of enforcing that, so I don't really care. Whatever.

Enjoy!
